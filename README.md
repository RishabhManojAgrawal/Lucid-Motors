- 10 Bus Stops
- 5 Buses
- The time to drive between any two contiguous stops is 5 minutes or 300 seconds
- The passenger's mean arrival rate at each stop is 5 persons/min or 0.083 persons/sec.
- The boarding time is for 10 seconds for each passenger.
- The total simulation time is 8 hours or 28800 seconds.
